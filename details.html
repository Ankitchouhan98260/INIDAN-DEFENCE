                <p>The Indian Air Force was officially established on 8 October 1932. It was known as the Royal Indian
                    Air Force in recognition of its services during the Second World War. After Independence, the term
                    ‘Royal’ was omitted.

                    Air Force is to secure the Indian airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during a conflict. Apart
                    from the wars of independent India and humanitarian work, it has participated in many United Nations
                    peacekeeping missions.
